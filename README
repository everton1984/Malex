# REEffects

** Installing and Building **

This steps were tested on vanilla Ubuntu 16.10. Just go to the terminal and type the following sequence of commands:

- First install the required packages:

sudo apt-get install git cmake libcgal-dev libgdal-dev gnuplot python-numpy python-scipy

- Clone the repository on your preferred directory:
git clone https://github.com/everton1984/REEffects.git

- Change to the correct directory, configure and build:

cd REEffects
./configure
./build

You might end up with a linking problem with GDAL, for now the solution 
is to manually alter the Makefile inside build/CMakeFiles/get_chunks/links.txt
and change the position of -lgdal to the end of the file.

** Running **

Make sure you have a config file, examples can be found at the cfg directory. Then go to the root directory and type:

$./run.sh <config_file>

Fill the config_file part with the address to the config file you want to use.

Be aware that right now the run.sh script is not really failing very gracefully, in case you run into problems here
is a checklist before sending a bug report:

1. Make sure the output directory on the config file is correctly set and created.
2. Check that both the roads and features files exist as set on the config file.

In case you get an error message complaining that the Geometry is undefined please post a new feature request.
