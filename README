# Malex

** Using the MalexUbuntu Image **

In case youÂ´re unwilling or unable to install Malex just download and run 
the MalexSnapshot on VirtualBox, you will start Ubuntu with a terminal open at the Malex directory, simply 
read the Running section below.

** Installing and Building **

This steps were tested on vanilla Ubuntu 16.10. Just go to the terminal and type the following sequence of commands:

- First install the required packages:

sudo apt-get install git cmake libcgal-dev libgdal-dev gnuplot python-numpy python-scipy

- Clone the repository on your preferred directory:
git clone https://github.com/everton1984/Malex.git

- Change to the correct directory, configure and build:

cd Malex
./configure
./build

You might end up with a linking problem with GDAL, for now the solution 
is to manually alter the Makefile inside build/CMakeFiles/get_chunks/links.txt
and change the position of -lgdal to the end of the file.

** Running **

Make sure you have a config file, examples can be found at the cfg directory. Then go to the root directory and type:

$./run.sh <config_file>

Fill the config_file part with the address to the config file you want to use.

Be aware that right now the run.sh script is not really failing very gracefully, in case you run into problems here
is a checklist before sending a bug report:

1. Make sure the output directory on the config file is correctly set and created.
2. Check that both the roads and features files exist as set on the config file.

In case you get an error message complaining that the Geometry is undefined please post a new feature request.

** Changelog **

12/05/2016 - 
    # Now everything is way more straightforward just read the Building/Running section of this README.

10/05/2016 - 
    # Now you need the out folder, run get_chunks to create the visible neighborhoods of the points and finally run
    calc_ire.py
    # I'm using SciPy to calculate IRE.

25/04/2016 - 
    # You need boost, cgal, gmp, mpfr and gdal to build this. On Archlinux I had just to add gdal and cgal as I remember. Right now the "build"
script is ugly but it works, should think about updating it in the future.

Older[ Deprecated right now ] - 
    # Change include directory on the build script ** automate this **
    # Run pyire.py from within the bin directory so the module can be loaded ** fix this **
