# Malex

** Building **

You will need GDAl and CGAL to build and run this project. Once this is taken care at the root directory type:

$./configure
$./build

This should do the trick.

For the Python part you will need SciPy.

** Running **

Make sure you have a config file, examples can be found at the cfg directory. Then go to the root directory and type:

$./run.sh <config_file>

Fill the config_file part with the address to the config file you want to use.

    # Now everything is way more straightforward just read the Building/Running section of this README.

10/05/2016 - 
    # Now you need the out folder, run get_chunks to create the visible neighborhoods of the points and finally run
    calc_ire.py
    # I'm using SciPy to calculate IRE.

25/04/2016 - 
    # You need boost, cgal, gmp, mpfr and gdal to build this. On Archlinux I had just to add gdal and cgal as I remember. Right now the "build"
script is ugly but it works, should think about updating it in the future.

Older[ Deprecated right now ] - 
    # Change include directory on the build script ** automate this **
    # Run pyire.py from within the bin directory so the module can be loaded ** fix this **
